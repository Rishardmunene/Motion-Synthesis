# AnimateDiff Temporal Coherence Research

## Overview

This project focuses on improving temporal coherence in motion synthesis using AnimateDiff. The research aims to:

- Prototype and experiment with temporal coherence in animation generation
- Fine-tune AnimateDiff for smoother and more coherent animations
- Compare motion synthesis outputs with baseline approaches
- Develop temporal coherence metrics for benchmarking

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rishardmunene/Motion-Synthesis.git
cd Motion-Synthesis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `configs/config.yaml` to set up your experimental parameters:

- Data paths
- Training parameters
- Model architecture
- Evaluation metrics

### 3. Running Experiments

```bash
# Run the main experimental pipeline
python src/main.py

# Run specific experiments
python src/training/trainer.py --config configs/custom_config.yaml
```

## Key Components

### Temporal Coherence Module

The `TemporalCoherenceModule` in `src/models/animated_diffusion.py` implements:

- Frame-to-frame consistency enhancement
- Motion smoothness optimization
- Temporal attention mechanisms

### Evaluation Metrics

Located in `src/evaluation/metrics.py`, including:

- Frame consistency scoring
- Motion smoothness evaluation
- Comparative analysis with baselines

### Training Pipeline

The training system in `src/training/trainer.py` supports:

- Fine-tuning AnimateDiff
- Custom loss functions for temporal coherence
- Validation and model checkpointing
